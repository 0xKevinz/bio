Hey! My name is Kevin -- I'm just a guy that loves creating things people love. I started my coding at 12 and have been making stuff ever since! Entrepreneur by day, Open-source contributor by night. BSc Hons Computer Science.

Currently, I'm the Co-founder & CTO of <a href="https://socool.club/">SoCool - A Creator friendly DeFi platform</a> And <a href="https://metastream.network/">Metastream</a> - A Streaming-focused Game NFT Marketplace, where I get to work w/ an amazing team focused on creating communities of people pushing new frontiers -- particularly in web3. We're backed by <a href="https://chainlinklabs.com/startup/">Chainlink Labs</a> & <a href="https://www.thefactory.no/">TheFactory</a>

My top 3 fav Games lately:
<br>Warcraft III by Blizzard
<br>LoL by Riot Games
<br>PubG by KRAFTON

If you wanna follow along as I build stuff, follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/leovinh">here</a>. Anyways, stay true to yourself, keep exploring, keep shipping.
